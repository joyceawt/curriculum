# The Odin Project Curriculum

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. We help users learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer. 

This repo contains the actual lesson files used on our website. For the actual TOP app that pulls in this lesson content and contains our front-end and back-end code, please go to the [main TOP repo](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject).

## Curriculum

Our curriculum is divided into distinct courses, each covering the subject language in depth. The lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. Each course contains a listing of lessons interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give users the opportunity to practice what they are learning, thereby reinforcing and solidifying the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Completed projects may then be included in the user's portfolio.

The topics we cover include:
* HTML and CSS
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* React
* Javascript
* NodeJS
* SQL
* How to go about getting a job in the industry.

You may begin by starting off with the [Foundations path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), which covers git basics, HTML and CSS foundations, Flexbox and some Javascript bsics. Then, you can proceed by choosing either the [Fullstack Ruby On Rails path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) or [Fullstack Javascript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).
